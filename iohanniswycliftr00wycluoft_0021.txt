havevery little to do with what precedes or follows. The two next
chapters, xvn and xvm, are chiefly devoted to the question of the anti-
quity of the Church. In opposition to those who maintain that the
Church only arose after Christ’s death, W yclif shows (as he says himself)
by very exhaustive reasoning, that the Church existed long before
Christ's incarnation. The relation of the reprobate to the Church, already
treated by Wyclif in the second and following chapter8‚ forms a main
part of chapter XIX. Wyclif gives special attention to the enquiry
whether a praescitus may hold a spiritual office (a question which
he⁴ answers in the negative); he then enquires by what marks the
praescitus priest may be known, and how the Christian should act
with regard to his spiritual functions. The layman need not be
disturbed‚ provided that he himself hold the true faith.¹ But if no
praescitus belongs to the ’fellowship of the Church, not having
indeed received a valid baptism—the question ariseS, What merit
will the praescitus gain for time and eternity, should he lead a right
life? In this world he will obtain prosperity, and a mitigation of his
penalty in the next.

Only he who holds the true view of the Church—Wyclif further
teaches—can rightly understand certain passages in the Song of
SongS, in the book of Proverbs, and in the Apocalypse. The whole
of the twentieth chapter is an exposition of Prov. xxxt. 10—31.
The exposition is on the model of St. Augustine and is partly borrowed
from his commentary on the same passages (Opp. v, pars 1.‚ pag.
151 — 194). This chapter has also a parallel in one of Wyclif's sermom,
and was perhaps composed earlier than the other portions of this work.

Wyclif's doctrine, that if the clergy should misuse their power, it
behoved the laity to deprive them of their temporalities‚ naturally
found vehement opponents amongst the clerical ranks. Chapter xxl.
contains a reply to one of these. The rest of the chapter, as also
chapter XXII, is chiefly occupied with a succession of subtle question-
ings concerning prayers for the dead, and the number and nature of
the Sacraments, especially as to what is received in the ordination of
