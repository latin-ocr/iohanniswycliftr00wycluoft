prerogatives of the Abbey. But here was a case of open treason‚

the example of Christ and of the early Church (Cap. xm).

There is no warrant in Holy Scripture for the secular wealth
of the Church. Itis the cause of many dangers: the only expla-
nation of the present schism is to be found in the insatiable desire
of the clergy for worldly goodS.³ If the clergy would but live in
evangelical poverty, as in the time of Christ, all disputes amongst
the nations of Christendom would come to an end. Therefore those
persons are in error, who believe that the more they spend upon
the Church, the greater their merit: a cup of cold water offered
sincerely and with good will, is perhaps a gift of higher value than
