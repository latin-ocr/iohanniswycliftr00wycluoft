xii INTRODUCTION.

In what sense then are we to understand these privileges?
(Cap. xl.) The King of England rnay bestow privileges for the advantage
of the Church, by virtue of his royal power. Therefore he alone has
the right to interpret them3 and if the Bishop of Rome, or any of
his priests learned in the law, should be asked concerning the inter-
pretation of a privilege, they are bound to explain it according to the
evangelical law, and they must not be obeyed if their explanation is
not founded on Holy Scripture.1 In the enquiry concerning privileges,
their original intention must be kept in vieW, as well as their letter.
The end for which the Abbey of Westminster was founded, namely, ⁴
the honouring of God in His saintS, the repose of the monkS, and the
dignity of the sanctuary, is not attained by these exemptionS, which
hinder the course of justice, and disturb the peace of the monkS. In the
bull of Nicolas ΙΙΙ for the Abbey it is expressly stated that the monks
are to be subject to no one, except the King; If then the monks
in the Abbey owe obedience to the King‚ much more must the King's
own vassals who took refuge there, do 80,‘-' for they could certainly
claim no greater immunities than the monks themselves, No privilege
ought to interfere with the common right, else it would be contrary
to justicess. The advantage accruing to those who seek shelter in
Westminster Abbey consists solely in a peculiar protection being
afforded them, which must not be allowed to injure otherS. This
privilege screens no fugitive from deserved punishment. It would
be better for the consecrated places themselves that they should not
possess privileges which burden them with worldly care. However, the

1 Rex Anglie debet concedere leges tales privatas de suo regali dominio ad
edificacionem ecclesie, ideo capiendum est tamquam per se notum quod regis est
illas leges privatas ac elemosinas interpretari et in rectitudine sua defendere. Romanus
autem pontifex super isto consultus et sacerdos suus legius requisitus de interpre-
tacione sensus catholice tenentur de lege evangelica quantum sciunt humiliter
declarare3 quibus non est parendum nisi de quanto sentenciam suam fundaverint
in scriptura. ² In privilegiis Edgari regis triplex finis exprimitur, scilicet
reverencia Dei in reliquiis sui apostoli, quies monachorum ibidem ‘degencium et
honor sanctitatis illius loci . . . In bulla Nicolai 111 sic habetur= Monachi ibidem
nulli omnino persone subdantur nisi regi. Ex quo videtur quod incole istius loci
non solum quia legii hominis regis, sed ex mandato pape regi suo sunt subiecti . . . .
3 Nullum privilegium est nisi communi contrarium, narn si foret, tunc esset contra
iusticiam et per consequens lex iniqua et non privilegium.
