’ ¹ 1. Oriqin and contents of the book “On the Ghuroh’‘.

At the present date, at which only a comparatively small portion
of Wyclif’s works have appeared in print, it may still be doubtful to
-, which of them the palm belong8‚ both in respect of form and contents;
,2 but at least it may safely be said, that his book on the Church must
be'reckoned amongst his ripest and most important utteranceS. For,
flet us consider what a powerful impression the work by Hus
‘bearing the same title, produced upon his contemporaries; a work
ἶ* which, as Pierre d'Ajlly said,1 “by its immense abundance of proofS‚
combats the authority and plenary power of the Pope, no less than
132the Koran' combags the Catholic 2-faith”. And yet this celebrated
'book is only a meagre abridgment of Wyclif's “De Ecclesia'’. What
, if the contemporaries of Hu8, who as assembled at Constance
,represented the intellectual capacity of the Europe of that day, had
fjlmown the original that he had drawn upon, instead of the feeble
’ {32i-mitation!

” In order rightly to understand the origin of the treatise on the
'‘Church‚ we must go back to the years 1377 and 1378, during
which Wyclif found himself exposed to attack from the combined
[forces of the hierarchy‚ or, as many at that time said, of the Church
The hierarchy however is not the Church: and it is the distinction
›between what the Church 1s in reality‚ and what the multitude under-
-d by it, 2 which Wyclif sets himself to expound in this work.
