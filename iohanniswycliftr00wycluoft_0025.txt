. εἶῆκιγ- ·Ieaves at the beginning and end of the volume. As this
ἴ dation was due to the benevolence of Simon of Tissnow‚ one
d the most zealous of the Bohemian Wycliffites‚ we may gather that
ὡς Codex was at one time in his possession. At least he is known

§ruint only to have been thoroughly familiar with Wyclif's work on the
JChurch, but to have imitated it himself.

All the tracts in A are written by the same hand.1n this hand
“also are the numerous Czechian glosses‚ of which the principal appears
J. in the faesimile forming the frontispiece to this volume. The indices
, at the end of each of the tracts are in a later hand. The corrections
ἒβη-τεά or black ink) are very carefully entered. The handwriting is
,, a very neat one: and the division of the work into chapter3‚ and of
’ chapters into paragraphs διε. is clearly marked. Large letters on the left
margin indicate the beginning of the paragraphs: whilst a further
122.subdivision is made by small letters or figureS‚ placed on the right
οι· left hand according to the space at command.
ζ ,· The contents of the paragraphs are noted either on the upper
. m· lower margins, Besides this notice of contentS‚ the margins contain
various disjointed comments on the text — expressions of agreement,
’ >⁴applause‚ derision etc. — names of authors referred to in the text,
,ἶ and· so on.

’ As this manuscript has been already described by Buddensieg‚ it
will only be necessary here to refer to his account of it. ¹ The tract
“De ecclesia’' is on fol.1³-114³‚ and is written by the same hand
aas the other works contained 1n this Codex The copyist was a Bohemian‚
md no friend to the GermanS‚ as appears from a marginal note (fol.
-74b)· “Olus est herba melancolica que signat mundo deditus et ideo
Theotumci pre aliis gentibus comedunt oluS‚ quia plus sunt mundo
avaricie dediti”. That this copy was not finished until after the
¹¹¹ of May 1415, is evident from the following gloss: “Et Johannes
,θ ξ ια XXIII. ., qui pro heretico et diabolo incarnato est condempnatus
