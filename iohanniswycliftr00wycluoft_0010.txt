iv INTRODUCTION.

“When people speak of the Church‚'' says Wyclif, “they mean
thereby prelates and priestS, endowed monkS, canons and begging
friars (‘prelatis and presti3‚ monkis and chanouns and freris'), and all
who wear the tonsure (‘alle men that han crownes'), however disrepu·
table and contrary to the word of God their life may be. On the
other hand, they say that people in the world are not men of the
holy Church, though they live ever so faithfully according to God’s
law, and die in perfect love of their neighbour. But notwithstanding
this, all those who will one day be blessed in heaven are members of
holy Church, and no one besides.’'¹

In other passages also he argues in a similar manner against the
belief that by the Church is to be understood only the visible
Catholic Church, i. e. in its character of an organised community‚
under priestly government: and the notion that the Church and the
clerical body are identical, so that all members of the latter would
belong to the Church, whereas the laity would be excluded from it.2

This false conception—so Wyclif declares—is to be met with
even amongst men holding high ecclesiastical officeS,³ and yet it is
evident‚ that many of the errors into which Christians. have fallen,
·are a result of this conception.4 He maintains it to be especially
needful at this time to prepare the way for a juster view of the
Church:⁵ and that the Bishops ought to rejoice that this should
be done, because the responsibility of instructing the people in the
true belief concerning the Church, and of repelling all attacks made
upon the Church by heretics lies heaviest upon them.⁰

To turn to the contents of “De Ecclesia”.

The work falls into four partS, which are closely connected with
one another. The first defines and elucidates Wyclif’s conception of
the Church, and the relation to the Church of the clerical order and
