XX INTRODUCTION.

This codex is almost wholly valueless for the purpose of obtaining
a correct text of “De Ecclesia'’, being simply a copy of A. This is
clear from the following facts:

1. Numerous peculiarities ofA are also to be found in A¹ e. g.
the repeated spelling “cunta” for“cuncta'’; “consilium’' for “concilium’'.

2. The lacunae of A are also in A1.

3. Repetitions of particular words 1n A occur also in A,.

4. Al has the same copyist's blunders as A: e. g. ‘ffactum'’ for
‘ffalsum’'; “ceteris pauperibus'’ instead of “ceteris paribus”; “paucis-
centz'bus” instead of ‘paciscentibus’ss

5. Corrections in A are found also in A„ for example, accusant
with the n crossed out.

6. Words which are not clearly written in A, are either equally
indistinct in A„ or else they have been misread, or. lastly, there is
an attempt at explanation in the margin. Thus, for example, A has in
one place “va—cat'' (the well-known word denoting that a passage in
the Codex has been effaced): A1 reads “va, ea'’, and then omits the
syllable “cat’'. In A we read on fol. 197d, “primo inquit’', and before
“primo’' is a stroke 1: this Al has taken for “in'’, so that now the
passage stands “in primo inquit’'. .

7. Α marginal note of A has been incorporated into the text of A,
(fol. 173 in A: vide cap. 22 huius).

8. Many emendations in A have been disregarded by the copyist
of A„ and thus the first errors of A remain in Al, for example, A
(fol. 198b) “careat casea-&3 Al “careat careat''.

9. The copyist of A wrote the fourth chapter on Whitsun
Eve: “In vigilia Pentecostes'': even these words have been tran-
scribed in At·

Under these circumstances it will be readily seen, that the variants
of A„ where such occur, do not offer any improvement upon the
text of A, but generally the reverse. In the present edition therefore,
only a selection from the readings of A1 has been given, consisting
solely of those in which an emendation of presumably corrupt passages
in A has been attempted. The relation of A, to A being what
has been shown, it would serve no purpose of scholarship, and
would merely add needlessly to the mass of readings, to give all the
variants of Al.
