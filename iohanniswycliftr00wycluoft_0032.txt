4. The Imitations of Wyclif’s tract. on the Church.

a. The treatise of John Hus “Coneerning the Churoh”.

Wyclif's book on the Church received more honour abroad than
at home. ssy the year 1407 at latest, its contents were known in
Bohemia, and on Bohemian soil the English master found an apostle‚
Magister John of Hussinec‚ called Hus, who embraced his teaching
with enthusiasm, and proved ready cheerfully to die for it. From the
very beginning of the movement of reform, Hus warmly hailed the
appearance of Wyclif's writings‚ and so far as they came within his‘
reach, he imbibed and reproduced their teaching, which became part
and parcel of his own mind. But of all Wyclif's workS‚ none fascin-
ated him to such a degree as the book on the Church. As early as
1412, the year of the famous controversy on indulgences, he comes
forward with arguments which are simply and entirely Wyclif’s:
and his well-known pamphlet on papal absolution is for the most
part taken word for word from the 23⁸¹ chapter of Wyclif's “De
ecclesia''.1 From the opening definition of absolution, to the close
of the deductions which follow, all is the intellectual property of
Wyclif. Hus also borrowed the arguments in support of five propo-
sitions of Wyclif's, which he gave to the world soon afterwards,
from the treatise on the Church.2 In the spring of 1413 King Wenzel
of Bohemia made an attempt to restore the broken peace of the
Church in his dominionS, and to this end to reconcile the Magister
John Hus with his opponents, The attempt was however a failure.
The two parties could come to no understanding over the concep-
tion of the Church. The opponents understood by the Church that
of which the Pope was the head, and the college of Cardinals the
body3 — Hus, on the other hand, had completely adopted the
VVycliffian doctrine of the Church, explained above. Against these
opponents he wrote, in imitation of Wyclif, his book “On the Church’',
a work which created in its day a most powerful sensation, whilst
